The AlphaFold paper in Nature grounds its advances on several streams of prior work. It builds on decades of experimental structure determination through crystallography, cryo-EM, and NMR that underpin the Protein Data Bank as the essential training resource. From theory, the study relies on classic formulations of the protein folding problem developed by Anfinsen, Dill, and colleagues that defined sequence-to-structure principles. Computationally, it draws from earlier comparative modeling methods by Šali and Blundell as well as Zhang’s I-TASSER, and from co-evolutionary analyses that first linked correlated mutations to structural contacts, such as the work of Altschuh, Marks, Jones, and Weigt. Deep learning–based contact prediction models, including those by Senior and colleagues, Wang and colleagues, and Zheng and colleagues, provided immediate precedents for machine learning approaches to folding. The critical CASP benchmarks established by Moult and collaborators created the rigorous testing framework in which AlphaFold’s performance is assessed. Together, these experimental, theoretical, and computational foundations created the conditions for DeepMind’s integration of physical principles with advanced neural networks to achieve near-atomic accuracy.
